                         <h2>Why Size-ALL?</h2>
                         <h1 id="small">Save time and tears with Size-ALL.</h1>
                        <p>For decades, men and women have subjected themselves to a life of relentless shopping disappointments. One of those disappointments involves being let down by the racks of clothing that do not display your size. For example, have you ever struggled with never finding your size at a store? Purchasing online clothing to find out it doesn't fit? Or even worse, not even knowing your exact measurements? To top it all of different brands use unique scales and units of measurements, which can be confusing to the average costumer. Aren't you tired of all of this?  Well then you've come to the right place. </p>
                        <p> Size-all is a website created by four individuals who have experienced a similar situation. By using size-all, you save yourself the time of being disappointed by another local department store, and instead, discover other stores that actually have your size!</p>
                        <h2>How it Works.</h2>
                        <p>Size-ALL works by collecting data from the user's input. The user inputs their measurements in centimeters. The data is then collected and our site searches all of the possible stores that have these exact measurements or measurements similar to the users.  </p>
                        <p>As of now, our website only collects data measurements in centimeters, clothing only available for women and aswell as having a selected number of stores.</p>
                        <p>Hopefully in the near future, Size-ALL will be updated to have more functionality.</p>
